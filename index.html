  <h3>Welcome to Canada Statistics</h3>
	<img id="flag" src="images/C1.jpg">
  <p>According to data from the 2016 census by Statistics Canada, 21.9% of the Canadian population reported they were or had ever been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada – nearly the 22.3% recorded during the 1921 Census, which was the highest level since the 1867 Confederation of Canada.[2] More than one in five Canadians were born abroad, and 22.3% of the population belonged to visible minorities, of whom 3 in 10 were born in Canada.[2]

In 2013–2014, most of the Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, supported either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.[3][4] A 2014 sociological study concluded that "Australia and Canada are the most receptive to immigration among western nations".[5] In 2017, an Angus Reid poll indicated a majority of respondents believed that Canada should accept fewer immigrants and refugees.[6]

Canadian immigration policies are still evolving. In 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada made significant changes to streamline the steady flow of immigrants, such as changes reducing professional categories for skilled immigration as well as caps for immigrants in various categories.[7] In 2015, Canada introduced the Express Entry system, providing a streamlined application process for many economic immigrants.[8] Additional changes were made in April and May 2017.[1] In November 2017, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen announced that Canada would admit nearly 1 million permanent residents to Canada over the following three years, rising from 0.7% to 1% of its population by 2020.[9] This increase was motivated by the economic needs of the country facing an aging demographic, with the number of senior citizens expected to double by 2036 alongside a decline in the proportion of working-age adults.</p>
